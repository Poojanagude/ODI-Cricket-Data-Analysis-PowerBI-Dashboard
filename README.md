# ODI-Cricket-Data-Analysis-PowerBI-Dashboard
The objective of the ePSN Cricket Data Analysis Power BI dashboard is to provide a centralized, interactive, and visually intuitive platform that converts cricket data into actionable insights for analysts, cricket enthusiasts, and decision-makers.


📊 Problem Statement
EPSN – ODI Cricket Data Analysis using Power BI

One Day International (ODI) cricket generates high-volume, multi-entity statistical data across batting, bowling, and fielding dimensions. The raw dataset consists of match-level and player-level records spanning multiple years, containing performance indicators such as runs, strike rate, overs, wickets, economy, catches, dismissals, innings data, and match outcomes.

However, the dataset lacks:

A normalized analytical structure for performance benchmarking

KPI standardization across batting, bowling, and fielding

Dynamic filtering for player-wise and time-based analysis

Multi-dimensional drill-down capabilities

Optimized aggregation logic for advanced cricket metrics

🎯 Core Technical Challenge

Design and implement a scalable Business Intelligence solution in Power BI that transforms raw ODI match data into a structured analytical model capable of delivering interactive, player-centric performance insights.

🏏 Batting KPIs

Batting Average = Total Runs / (Innings – Not Outs)

Strike Rate = (Runs / Balls) × 100

Highest Score

4s and 6s Distribution

Half-Centuries and Centuries

Span Analysis (Career Duration)

🎯 Bowling KPIs

Bowling Average = Runs Conceded / Wickets

Economy Rate = Runs Conceded / Overs

Bowling Strike Rate = Balls Bowled / Wickets

Best Bowling Figures (e.g., 3/34)

Maiden Overs Analysis

5-Wicket Hauls
